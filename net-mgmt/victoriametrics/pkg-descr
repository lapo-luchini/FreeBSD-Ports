VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable monitoring
solution and time series database.

Prominent features
- can be used as long-term storage for Prometheus or for vmagent.
- supports Prometheus querying API, so it can be used as Prometheus
  drop-in replacement in Grafana.
- implements MetricsQL query language backwards compatible with PromQL.
- uses 10x less RAM than InfluxDB and up to 7x less RAM than Prometheus,
  Thanos or Cortex when dealing with millions of unique time series
  (aka high cardinality).
- high data compression, so up to 70x more data points may be crammed
  into limited storage comparing to TimescaleDB and up to 7x less storage
  space is required comparing to Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
