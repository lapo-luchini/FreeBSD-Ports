Automated repairs for Apache Cassandra

Reaper is a centralized, stateful, and highly configurable tool for
running Apache Cassandra repairs against single or multi-site clusters.

The current version supports running Apache Cassandra cluster repairs in
a segmented manner, opportunistically running multiple parallel repairs at
the same time on different nodes within the cluster.
Basic repair scheduling functionality is also supported.

Reaper comes with a GUI.
